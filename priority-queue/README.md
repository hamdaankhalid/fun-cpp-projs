## Project Challenge: Implement a Priority Queue using a Heap

Description:
Create a C++ project that involves implementing a Priority Queue using a binary heap. The project should consist of the following components:

Heap Implementation:

Implement a binary heap class that can be used as a base for the priority queue.
Use smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) for managing memory.
Priority Queue Class:

Build a priority queue class on top of the binary heap.
The priority queue should support insertion and extraction of elements based on their priority.
Object-Oriented Design:

Design the classes in an object-oriented manner, encapsulating the details of the heap and priority queue.
Utilize inheritance and polymorphism if applicable.
Intense Code:

Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., heapsort) using the priority queue.
Objectives:
Understand the implementation of a binary heap and its applications in a priority queue.
Apply object-oriented programming principles for creating reusable and extensible code.
Implement a sorting algorithm and analyze its performance using the priority queue.

Create a visualization of the binary heap and priority queue operations.
